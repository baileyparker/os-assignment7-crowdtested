# Crowdtesting for OS (3|4)18 Assignment 7

![It's dangerous to go alone! (Share yours) Take this.](https://craftinggeek.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/th-63.jpg)

If you go at this one alone, you're going to have a bad time. If you write tests, you'll have a better time. If you share tests, you'll have an amazing time. Help your peers, help yourself (and "insire" NWF's test cases)! May the odds be ever in your favor.

### [As Joe Biden would say](http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2015/fall/cs318/assignment-kthreads.shtml#suggested-plan-of-attack),

### How to Share

  - Submit a PR with your test cases (please use NWF's TAP test harness)
  - Only submit your test's `*.c` files (please name them `crowd_*.c` where `*` is some descritive name)
  - Please verify that your tests work!
  - Pat yourself on the back for being an awesome person :)
